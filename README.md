# UK-King's Cross
A contributor named SMG4 submitted this railway several years ago but publication awaited a timetable.  Unfortunately no timetable was submitted so it was left gathering dust.  It was a detailed and impressive layout so it seemed appropriate to resurrect and update it in line with the current track layout, and develop a timetable for it.

The railway includes the lines from King's Cross and Moorgate in the south to Biggleswade on the East Coast Main Line and Royston on the Cambridge line, a distance of over 40 miles in all.

The timetable corresponds to the 2021 summer working timetable (courtesy www.realtimetrains.co.uk) and includes all King's Cross and Moorgate services from just before 6:00am to after 2:00pm.  Excluded so far are freight, St Pancras services and other services that avoid King's Cross or Moorgate.

Operation is quite intense most of the time - it isn't a railway for the faint-hearted!  There are few opportunities for speeding up from 1x operation, and 1/2x and even 1/4x are required at especially busy times.  The 'Actions due' panel will be needed all the time to keep on top of movements.

Operational help will be provided in the Documentation folder.
